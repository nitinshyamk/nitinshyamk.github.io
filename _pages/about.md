I'm a first year PhD student at NYU Courant (currently remote in Seattle, WA) studying machine learning focusing on data driven control and model based RL. I'm also interested in ML engineering, specifically GPU accelerated routines, see my [github](https://github.com/nitinshyamk/operator-inference-cuda) for recent projects.

Previously I worked for three years as a Senior Software Engineer at Applied Predictive Technologies on modeling pipelines. I provided technical and team leadership on a team of four, mentored multiple junior teammates, led or co-led research investigations, co-led APT's Cornell recruiting efforts, and contributed to a range of diversity initiatives. 

I graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Cornell University as a Tanner Dean's Scholar in May 2017 with B.A.s in Mathematics (cum laude) and Computer Science. I spent most of my time outside class doing research, first with Jesse Goldberg in the field of mammalian motor control, and secondly with Siddhartha Banerjee on randomized personal PageRank.
