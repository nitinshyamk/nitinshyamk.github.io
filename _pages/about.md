I'm a first year PhD student at NYU Courant, broadly interested in the intersection of applied mathematics, machine learning, and scientific computing. 

Previously, I worked as a Senior Software Engineer at Applied Predictive Technologies for three years on pipelines for statistical modeling. At APT, I provided technical and team leadership on a team of four, mentored multiple junior teammates, led or co-led a few research investigations, co-led APT's Cornell recruiting efforts, and helped contribute to a range of diversity initiatives. I started at APT after graduating from Cornell University in May 2017. I received a B.A. in Mathematics (cum laude), a B.A. in Computer Science, and graduated Phi Beta Kappa as a Tanner Dean's scholar.

During my time at Cornell, I worked with Siddhartha Banerjee on using randomized personal PageRank algorithms to solve sparse matrix equations and in Jesse H. Goldberg in his computational neuroscience lab studying mammalian motor control.
